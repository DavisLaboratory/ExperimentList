Description: The ExperimentList package defines S4 classes to handle data from 
  multiple experiments or studies by providing features of lists as well as those
  of a concatenated experiment. Individual experiments can be in the form of 
  SummarizedExperiment, Ranged SummarizedExperiment, SingleCellExperiment, or 
  SpatialExperiment objects. Annotations specific to each experiment are stored
  thus providing a unified interface to dealing with data from multiple studies.
  Specialised functions to access experiment data, and to apply functions across
  experiments are implemented. Existing functions implemented for each individual
  experiment (e.g., SingleCellExperiment::reducedDim()) can be readily applied
  across the entire list of experiments.
